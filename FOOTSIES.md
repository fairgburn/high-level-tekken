# Rules of Footsies

1. If you use a move that outranges your opponent's move, you are more likely to win, thus ranged pokes beat jabs.  
2. If you use a move that starts up before your opponents move, you will win.  
3. If you use a move later than your opponent's active frames, you can punish their recovery.  
4. Attacks beat throws, because they have more range. This doesn't apply in point-blank range, because throws are faster than most attacks.  
5. Blocks beat attacks, because they prevent damage, and can punish unsafe moves.  
6. Throws beat blocks, because throws are unblockable.  
7. Attacking extends your hurtbox, thus your limb can be hit if you miss.  
8. Movement is not reactable, therefore moving and blocking can bait attacks.  
9. Moving backwards can let you evade attacks, but can place yourself in the corner, removing your ability to make space or whiff punish effectively.  
10. Sidestepping can let you evade attacks, reposition yourself, or negate the enemy’s sidestep, but can be stopped by attacks that connect in that direction.

How do you attack the opponent who is not in the attack range??? **Answer: Move into range and attack. The important part is that you have to get into the opponent's range through forward movement (Approaching)** 

How do you stop the opponent from getting in? **Answer: Stop them by covering the area with an attack. (Keepout)** 

How do you beat the opponent who just puts moves on the screen? **Answer: Punish their missed attack with a long reaching move, through prediction or reaction. (Whiff Punishment)** 

How do you deal with an opponent who just waits for a chance to whiff punish? **Answer: If the opponent is waiting for your attack, you have a chance to move into range and land a hit. (Approach and attack/Rushdown)** 

Both players constantly switch between these components to create the **Sansukumi, the foundation of footsies.**
