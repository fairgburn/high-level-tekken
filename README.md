## LEVEL 1

### Small Tekken
Small tekken, according to Mingriah, is quite literally **doing small moves.**  tekken can be simplified to a select portion of moves, around 7 to 8, sometimes more. These moves consist of your character’s best moves in the neutral game (pokes, highs, mids and fast lows, rage art Heat Burst) and tools to punish the opponent for whiffing (strings, launchers). You can use pokes to gather information on your opponent’s tendencies, or to just hit the other guy if you think it’s a good idea.

### Moving With a Purpose
**Moving with a purpose** means that your main source of moving **__backwards__** is through proper backdash cancels, limited to a certain amount (__JDCR’s Rule: 3 or less__) in order to maintain proper space control and your main source of moving **__forward__** is through dash blocking in order to not get hit while approaching.
     **Sidestepping** should not occur in the neutral without a proper reason:
       1. Get away from the wall
        2. Avoid an attack
      3. Negate an opponent's sidestep
Backdashing should be used to create space, or avoid an attack. *Don't abuse it.*

### Patience
Patience in tekken primarily requires discipline as well as the **Matchup Knowledge Prerequisite**. It’s important to understand that certain characters require you to **press less to virtually no buttons** in order to play against them properly. Movement must be clean, accurate and consistent in order to ensure you don’t get hit while defending.


## LEVEL 2

**__The Mingriah Commandments__**
1. __*Do the moves to see their moves.*__
[This Commandment states that you take a select number of moves from your **small tekken** moves and use them to gather information on your opponent’s tendencies. Generally smaller moves are used so that you can stay safe and even force different situations based on the gathered info]

2. __*If you have shitty moves, get better moves.*__
[Another simplified commandment. Don’t be afraid to apply different tools if the ones you use currently are weaker or have glaring drawbacks.]

3. __*You play small tekken by doing small moves.*__
[Refer to **small tekken**]

4. __*You win in tekken by hitting the other guy.*__
[Attacking the opponent is mandatory since you need a greater amount of health than your opponent in order to win, whether the time runs out or your opponent’s health reaches 0. **You must hit “the other guy” in order to win.**]

5. __*Look at the screen.*__
 
### “Looking At the Screen”
This Concept in tekken can be simplified to “Paying Attention”, but at the same time can be translated to “Preparing to react.” This Vague statement can have multiple meanings, designed to make you focus on the situation at hand. In one scenario, “Looking at the screen” could mean to focus on whiff punishment and in another scenario it could mean to react to a low attack.

### **__Attaining a Higher Mindset__**
Attaining a mindset in tekken where you engage in **critical thinking** is paramount to facing extremely strong players. The ability to analyze facts, observations, concepts and methods, form judgements on them, and then take them and simplify them. 

__Example Quote:__ *“You don’t have to Open me up. You just have to hit me. If your opponent is blocking mid/high, don’t think ‘how do I make him duck?’ Think ‘Lows will hit him.’ Then you play around the damage and the reads from the new health position.”*

## LEVEL 3

### Movement for Option Coverage
Most Characters in the game have multiple options to deal with how you defend against their interactions. **__You are never forced to commit to a singular movement option for defense, but instead you have the option to chain multiple forms of movement together.__** **Backdash -> Duck** or **Sidestep -> Duck** can be utilized to __add an extra layer of coverage to your defense.__

**Example: Option Coverage Movement**

### Attacking with Nothing
There are times in tekken where forcing the opponent to hesitate is the best option in order to open up more opportunities for you to initiate offense. Forward dashing towards the opponent **creates a visage of aggression**, and can throw the opponents thinking off-kilter to **condition them to defend against an incoming attack**. With this in mind, __movement can be used as an “empty” form of offense in order to force hesitation.__

## LEVEL 4

### Timing
Timing is one of the more difficult concepts to grasp. During a frame situation, opponents always have the option to delay their options in order to throw off your own timing. Timing can be simplified into 3 categories.  

**Immediate Timing**  


![timing1.mp4](./embed/timing1.mp4)


**Short Delay Timing**  


![timing2.mp4](./embed/timing2.mp4)


**Long Delay Timing**  


![timing3.mp4](./embed/timing3.mp4)




__It’s very important to observe and adapt to the timings which your opponent connects their attacks, and tailor your own timing and habits to beat theirs.__ **Timing can be changed through the use of patience, longer startup attacks, or through movement.**

*“In tekken, frame advantage and disadvantage is a spectrum that exists in the context of the stage and space between each specific character on-screen. It's great to fall back onto the fundamental application of frame data that can be played directly by the numbers, but complex application through the use of timing, spacing, and other character-specific options should ALWAYS be encouraged.”*  
~ Loko Makoto

**__Simplifying Mental Stack__**  
In the heat of a real match, it’s very easy to get overwhelmed mentally when you’re focused on covering multiple options. Once that happens, the opponent is granted multiple opportunities to stiffen your neutral and force hesitation.

**Example: round 1 leading to overloaded mental stack round 2**  
![mental-stack.mp4](./embed/mental-stack.mp4)

When feeling overloaded, reduce the information taken into a core set of data.  
* __The remaining time in the round__  
* __The difference in health__  
* __Each player’s position on the stage__  
Reducing the amount of information will help you in your **decision making** and allow you to re engage in more critical thinking.

__Be sure to review the post-game matches__, using your **Character Matchup Knowledge** to help you understand what’s causing your mental stack. **Mental stack will naturally reduce with greater understanding and comfort with what your opponent can do to you or what interactions they can force you into.**
